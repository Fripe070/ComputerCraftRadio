# ComputerCraftRadio
A quick and dirty solution for playing youtube playlists using [ComputerCraft](https://tweaked.cc/)

This repo exists purely for archival purposes, please do not _actually use_ this.

Requires a python FastAPI server to be running ([`server.py`](./server.py))
[`client.lua`](./client.lua) should be run on a computer in game, with a speaker connected on any side.
